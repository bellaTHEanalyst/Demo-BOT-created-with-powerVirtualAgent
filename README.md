# Demo-BOT-created-with-powerVirtualAgent

I recently created a chatbot using Power Virtual Agents. The chatbot is called "Isabella fitness company" and it is designed to answer questions about fitness plans and subscriptions. I used natural language understanding to make my bot understand what users are saying, and I used entities to store information about users and their interactions with the Isabella fitness bot.

I also implemented a flow using Power Automate to streamline the process of retrieving feedback information and incorporating it into my Excel spreadsheet. 

The new flow has automated manual data entry and consolidation activities, which has allowed me to save a significant amount of time and effort. I can now concentrate more on reviewing the comments and drawing important conclusions from the data..
